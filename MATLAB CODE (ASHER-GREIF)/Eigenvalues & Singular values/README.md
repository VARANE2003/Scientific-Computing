# Key Differences
- Type of Matrix:  <br>
    Eigenvalues apply to square matrices, while singular values apply to any rectangular matrix.
- Nature of Values: <br>
    Eigenvalues can be complex numbers, while singular values are always non-negative real numbers.
- Applications:  <br>
    Eigenvalues are often used in stability analysis, differential equations, and systems of linear equations, while singular values are used in data compression, principal component analysis (PCA), and solving linear least squares problems.
