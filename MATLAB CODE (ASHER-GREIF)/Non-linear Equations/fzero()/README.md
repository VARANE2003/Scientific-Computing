The fzero() function in MATLAB uses a combination of methods to find the roots of a nonlinear equation. 
Specifically, it primarily employs:

<b>Brentâ€™s Method</b>: This is a root-finding algorithm that combines bisection, secant, and inverse quadratic interpolation methods. 
It is efficient and robust, ensuring convergence under a variety of conditions.

<b>Bisection Method</b>: If the initial guesses do not bracket a root (i.e., the function does not change signs between the guesses), 
fzero() may fall back to the bisection method, which guarantees convergence as long as the root is bracketed.

<b>Secant Method</b>: In cases where two initial points are close together, the secant method can be employed, which uses linear interpolation to find a root.

Overall, fzero() is designed to be robust and efficient, making it suitable for a wide range of nonlinear equations. 
If you provide an <em><b>initial guess that is close to the root</b></em>, it generally converges quickly to the solution.
