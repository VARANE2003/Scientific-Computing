# system_of_eqs()

The system of equations function system_of_eqs() defines both the system of nonlinear equations f1​(x1​,x2​)=x1^2​−2x1​−x2​+1 and f2​(x1​,x2​)=x1^2​+x2^2​−1, along with their Jacobian matrix. <br>
It also makes sure that the variables x1 and x2 are set to x(1) and x(2).  <br>
THIS IS NECESSARY when declaring the F matrix of f1 and f2 functions.      <br>
